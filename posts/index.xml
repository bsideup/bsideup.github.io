      <description>Ever wanted to override a method of an object instance in Java?
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to implement a custom Scheduler hook for Project Reactor. You start with Schedulers.addExecutorServiceDecorator, implement a BiFunction accepting Scheduler&amp;rsquo;s instance and ScheduledExecutorService and you need to return another ScheduledExecutorService instance where with schedule* methods wrapped with your code.
A straightforward approach would be to create a new class, implement all methods of ScheduledExecutorService interface, and delegate most of them to the instance of ScheduledExecutorService we received as an argument.</description>

      <description>As a JVM guy, I got used to &amp;ldquo;write once, run everywhere&amp;rdquo; paradigm. But recently I got an interesting challenge to solve.
I was working on a debugging tool for Project Reactor and part of it is implemented as a native library for Java, using JNI technology.
I did some C++ in the past but never thought how hard is it, to cross-compile a library for 3 major platforms (Windows, Linux and Mac), both locally and on CI environment (from where we perform the releases).</description>
