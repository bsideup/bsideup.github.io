      <title>The Builder pattern vs Java syntax</title>

      <description>The Builder pattern is one of the most popular patterns in Java.
It is simple, helps to keep objects immutable, and can be generated with tools like Project Lombok&amp;rsquo;s @Builder or Immutables, to name a few.
Example of a fluent variant of the pattern:
public class User { private final String firstName; private final String lastName; User(String firstName, String lastName) { this.firstName = firstName; this.lastName = lastName; } public static Builder builder() { return new Builder(); } public static class Builder { String firstName; String lastName; Builder firstName(String value) { this.</description>

      <title>My favourite GitHub bots</title>

      <description>Year 2018 was an eye-opening year for me as an OSS project maintainer. The reason is due to the emerge of GitHub bots.
Maintaining a project on GitHub could be a challenging task, especially when the project becomes popular. Issue management, releases, follow-ups, dependency management, oh my!
But, as most of the developers, we&amp;rsquo;re lazy enough and spend time automating things.

There are many nice bots, but Dependabot is a real &amp;ldquo;Good Boy Bot&amp;rdquo;!</description>

      <title>Easy Java delegates with Lombok</title>

      <description>Ever wanted to override a method of an object instance in Java?
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to implement a custom Scheduler hook for Project Reactor. You start with Schedulers.addExecutorServiceDecorator, implement a BiFunction accepting Scheduler&amp;rsquo;s instance and ScheduledExecutorService and you need to return another ScheduledExecutorService instance where schedule* methods wrapped with your code.
A straightforward approach would be to create a new class, implement all methods of ScheduledExecutorService interface, and delegate most of them to the instance of ScheduledExecutorService we received as an argument.</description>

      <title>JNI cross-compilation with Docker</title>

      <description>As a JVM guy, I got used to &amp;ldquo;write once, run everywhere&amp;rdquo; paradigm. But recently I got an interesting challenge to solve.
I was working on a debugging tool for Project Reactor and part of it is implemented as a native library for Java, using JNI technology.
I did some C++ in the past but never thought how hard is it, to cross-compile a library for 3 major platforms (Windows, Linux and Mac), both locally and on CI environment (from where we perform the releases).</description>
