      <description>The world is not perfect, so are the tests, and one day you will get&amp;hellip; a flaky test üò±
Flaky&amp;hellip; what? As per Neboj≈°a Striƒçeviƒá:
 An essential property of an automated test and the entire test suite is its determinism. This means that a test should always have the same result when the tested code doesn‚Äôt change. A test that fails randomly is commonly called a flaky test.</description>

      <title>Dependency Management in Gradle</title>

      <description>There is one super popular thing I never did/do in my Gradle projects:
ext { lib_version = &amp;#34;1.2.3&amp;#34; } dependencies { compile &amp;#34;org.corp:lib:$lib_version&amp;#34; } Why not? I know that this approach was/is popular among Maven projects.
But I always preferred the dependencyManagement section of a parent POM because&amp;hellip; it is standartized.
When you switch between projects and want to change a version of dependency, you know where you look at.</description>

      <description>As a JVM guy, I got used to &amp;ldquo;write once, run everywhere&amp;rdquo; paradigm. But recently I got an interesting challenge to solve.
I was working on a debugging tool for Project Reactor and part of it is implemented as a native library for Java, using JNI technology.
I did some C++ in the past but never thought how hard is it, to cross-compile a library for 3 major platforms (Windows, Linux and Mac), both locally and on CI environment (from where we perform the releases).</description>
