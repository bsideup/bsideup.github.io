      <description>Jackson is a great library for working with JSON.
However, it is a bit too heavyweight to have it as a public dependency of your API. Especially if you&amp;rsquo;re working on an Open Source library.
While refactoring docker-java, I got a challenge:
 There are two modules: api and core api module (unlike core) should not have any dependency core can be shaded, which means that we cannot use provided scope for Jackson&amp;rsquo;s annotations in api The entities in api have Jackson annotations like @JsonProperty, @JsonIgnore, @Creator and others Some entities require custom (de-)serialization  If not 4, everything would be so easy.</description>
