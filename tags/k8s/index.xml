      <description>Introduction Recently, I started playing with Kubernetes and Knative. The trigger was the credits I received to play with Oracle Cloud. I did not know how to use them and on which services (Java is the only Oracle&amp;rsquo;s product I use :D), so I googled &amp;ldquo;oracle cloud kubernetes&amp;rdquo; and 15 minutes later I had a running cluster to play with. Nice!
After installing Knative (k apply -f FTW!) and Gloo as a gateway, I decided to move one of my pet projects to this cluster, just to get the feeling of what it takes to run a few services on it.</description>
