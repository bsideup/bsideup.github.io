      <description>Most of my time I write Java code. It isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect, yet I find it good enough as my primary language. But sometimes I dream about the future of Java.
Given the latest activities around the Java language design (See Project Amber), the future looks brighter JEP-by-JEP, but one feature I really miss which isn&amp;rsquo;t discussed by Amber is&amp;hellip; Extension methods.
The problem Java language was heavily influenced by the OOP design.</description>

      <description>Ever wanted to override a method of an object instance in Java?
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to implement a custom Scheduler hook for Project Reactor. You start with Schedulers.addExecutorServiceDecorator, implement a BiFunction accepting Scheduler&amp;rsquo;s instance and ScheduledExecutorService and you need to return another ScheduledExecutorService instance where schedule* methods wrapped with your code.
A straightforward approach would be to create a new class, implement all methods of ScheduledExecutorService interface, and delegate most of them to the instance of ScheduledExecutorService we received as an argument.</description>
